![Clips4Sale](/docs/images/clips4sale-example-hilight.jpg)
Clips4Sale API automatically fills out the required fields on the add clip page using the video's metadata saved to your clipnuke account.

![XVideos](/docs/images/xvideos-example-hilight.jpg)
Some sites like PornHub and XVideos allow a user to specify 10+ translations for each title. ClipNuke includes an AI to **automatically translate the title to all languages with one click**. Imagine using Google Translate to translate each movie title to 30 different languages by hand. No thanks!

![PornHub](/docs/images/pornhub-example-hilight.jpg)
Pornhub also allows a user to specify translated movie titles to increase international viewership.

![ManyVids](/docs/images/manyvids-example-hilight.jpg)
**One-click launch**. Upload the video to a distributor's site and prefill the form right from clipnuke.com. No more copy-paste.

![Dashboard](/docs/images/admin-dashboard.PNG)
Track how much progress you've made with each distributor's site *at a glance*, and how many clips you still have left to launch. Link each clip to the video file on the distributor's site -- so you know which one's you've already uploaded, and which one's you still need to monetize.

## Features
- AI Auto-translator
- Search Engine to find your clips.
- Spreadsheet view that allows you to see what videos are uploaded to which site -- arranging sites by columns.

## Notes
- Using a browser extension allows the user to make changes (or complete) the form data while posting a new video. A producer may need to attach a 2257 model release, Driver's License, or other compliance document to each video. So we'll never be able to achieve full automation on those sites -- but this is the **best solution** by far. A sidekick app that modifies the upload video form itself when a user visit's the page.

What are you waiting for? Power up your clip store today! Mo' clips equals mo' money.
